# Implementation of my cross validation

The topic is the prediction of wine quality. 
The problem is transformed into a classification problem: <br>
the quality is either 0 or 1. 

The baseline result is the GridSearchCV of Scikit-learn.
The code performs an implementation of the cross validation algorithm and shows it perfectly fits the GridSearchCV results. 

TO RUN:

* jupyter notebook: cross_validation.ipynb
* module: my_cross_validation.py
