Implementation of my cross validation
=====================================

The topic is the prediction of wine quality. The problem is transformed in a classification problem: the quality is either 0 or 1.
The baseline result is the GridSearchCV of Scikit-learn.
The code performs an implementation of the cross validation algorithm and shows it perfectly fits the GridSearchCV results. 

TO RUN:
* jupyter notebook: cross_validation.ipynb
* module: my_cross_validation.py
